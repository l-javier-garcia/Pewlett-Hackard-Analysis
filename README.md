# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview
The goal of this analysis was to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program, with all this compiled we want to help prepare PH for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age. We are gathering the titles of current employees who were born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955, as well as create a mentorship-eligibility table that holds the current employees who were born between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965.

## Results
###### 1. Eagle-Eye View of the data
Pewlett Hackard will have 41,381 vacancies after the "silver tsunami" hits. We had a lot of people that had been promoted several times which made our data a little murky, but after cleaning the data with a DISTINCT ON () function we were able to delete the previous positions held by those employees. 
###### 2. Mentoring opportunities 
To help fill in the vacancies that the silver tsunami members will leave behind we found about 1550 employees that can help mentor younger employees.
###### 3. Engineering Leadership will vacate the most positions
The job position that will be vacated the most is the Senior Engineers at 29,414 positions. This could lead to lack of support to younger, less experienced engineers making repair and/or manufacture much longer. 
###### 4. Luckily, career spans are long in PH
What we're able to see from the data is that people that join PH last a very long time and there's plenty of room for employees to grow but vertically and horizontally if they feel they want to transition to a different field in the company. 

## Summary
###### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

###### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
